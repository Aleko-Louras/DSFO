<h2>DSFO is an Educational Data Structures and Algorithms App (C++/Qt/Box2d)</h2>
Learn Data structures and sorting algorithms in an airport simulated environment. Read word problems that apply real world concepts to DSA. Interact with our GUI that simulated certain
airport tasks related to the concept that you can mess around with for understanding. Afterwards, quiz yourself with quiz questions to enforce learning.
